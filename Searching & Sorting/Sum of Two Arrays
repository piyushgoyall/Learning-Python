# Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9
# (i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
# You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list 
# i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.
# Note:
# The sizes N and M can be different. 
# Output array/list(of all 0s) has been provided as a function argument. Its size will always be one more than the size of the bigger array/list. 
# Place 0 at the 0th index if there is no carry. 
# No need to print the elements of the output array/list.
# Using the function "sumOfTwoArrays", write the solution to the problem and store the answer inside this output array/list. 
# The main code will handle the printing of the output on its own.
# Input format :
# The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.
# First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.
# Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first array/list.
# Third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.
# Fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.
# Output Format :
# For each test case, print the required sum of the arrays/list in a row, separated by a single space.
# Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
# Sample Input 1:
# 1
# 3
# 6 2 4
# 3
# 7 5 6
# Sample Output 1:
# 1 3 8 0
# Sample Input 2:
# 2
# 3
# 8 5 2
# 2
# 1 3
# 4
# 9 7 6 1
# 3
# 4 5 9
# Sample Output 2:
# 0 8 6 5
# 1 0 2 2 0
