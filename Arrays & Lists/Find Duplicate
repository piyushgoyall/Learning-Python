# You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. 
# That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. 
# You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
# Note : Duplicate number is always present in the given array/list.
# Input format :
# The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.
# First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.
# Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
# Output Format :
# For each test case, print the duplicate element in the array/list.
# Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

# Sample Input 1:
# 1
# 9
# 0 7 2 5 4 7 1 3 6
# Sample Output 1:
# 7
# Sample Input 2:
# 2
# 5
# 0 2 1 3 1
# 7
# 0 3 1 5 4 3 2
# Sample Output 2:
# 1
# 3
